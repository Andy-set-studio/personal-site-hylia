I _really_ want to get into using Firefox and on the surface, it's great! One thing I'm struggling with is the service worker tools. 

With Chrome, I can completely bypass a service worker which is handy-as-heck. I can't seem to find the ability to do this with Firefox though. 

If anyone knows a way, please [let me know](mailto:andy@hankchizljaw.io) because I'd love to use Firefox for dev!

**Update**: I ended up [creating my own bypass instead](/wrote/bypass-service-worker-on-localhost/).
