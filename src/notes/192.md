Hey Pals ðŸ‘‹ 

I am taking bookings for September onwards and Iâ€™m specifically looking to work on new website / brochure site projects. 

Ideal projects would be: 

- I design and build you a website
- I build a website that you designed
- I design you a website and give you templates 

Stuff I focus on: 

- Progressive enhancement 
- Accessibility 
- Performance 
- User-focused design 

I would especially *love* to work with you if youâ€™re a non-profit or your business is aimed at helping people who need help the most.   My [DMs are open](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=98734097) or send an email to [me@andy-bell.design](mailto:me@andy-bell.design).
