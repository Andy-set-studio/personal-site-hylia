Hey Pals 👋

I have slots coming up in September and would love work with ✨you✨. DMs open!

Stuff I do: 

🎨 Web design  
🏗 Front-end development  
🍯 Jamstack and static site generators  
📦 NodeJS  
💖 #a11y and inclusive design

The ideal type of work to hire me for would be to make you a website or to help you to make a website, using clean HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I only use frameworks where absolutely appropriate.

If you’re an agency looking for help with a website project, definitely get in touch.
