It’s 200 days until Brexit and we’re sleepwalking into a disaster.

Labour are providing opposition that is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. They’ve actually spent more time opposing each other than the government. This amongst many reasons is why I moved my support to the Green Party. 


Remember this: Labour are as accountable as the Tories for this mess by providing no actual opposition to their utter incompetence.

I’m very worried about the future for my kids.
