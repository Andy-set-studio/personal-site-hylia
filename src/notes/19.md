I keep this £20 Android device in my desk drawer to test with. It loads [hankchizljaw.io](https://hankchizljaw.io) in around 8-10 seconds on fibre-to-the-door broadband. That is super slow considering the site is getting some good scores on Web Page Test.

I recommend getting a cheap device yourself. They're useful to keep an eye on things.
