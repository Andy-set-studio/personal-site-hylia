A little ðŸ”¥ tip for you:

You can use `outline` instead of `border` to achieve the same visual effect, but itâ€™ll bleed over the edges nicely.

Itâ€™s great for responsive elements like in this video:

A screencast of my browser resizing over an availability element on my site. Thereâ€™s a bright border that bleeds over the edges when the screen is shrunk.Â

I learned this trick from [@heydonworks](https://twitter.com/@heydonworks) because thatâ€™s how he got the sidebar border working perfectly on [every-layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev) with no breakpoints.
