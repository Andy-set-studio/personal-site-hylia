This is a follow up to [this note](/notes/34/).

Kids craft club was an interesting experience. I don’t think many kids touched any of the crafts—just very eager, competitive parents and grandparents.

Brooklyn and I made an aquarium together. It was good, wholesome fun. She needs a bit of that now that her little sister has arrived and she certainly looked like she enjoyed herself.
