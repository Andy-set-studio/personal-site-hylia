The more I understand how Mastodon works, the more I think it's going to be a great thing. I love how everyone could essentially have their own little home on the web and still be able to communicate in the context of a social network.

Yes, I know there are other options including RSS feeds—which I'm also falling back in love with—but Mastodon feels like it creates a bridge to welcome users of large social networks to the independent web.
