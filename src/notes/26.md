I reckon it's right about time to start boycotting Google. With the recent AMP and anti-URL crap, it's clear to see they are abusing their monopoly.

Let's stop using and recommending Chrome by default and set your default search engine to DuckDuckGo (or similar). Turn on your adblocker to starve them of income (Better Blocker is good as heck).

The best way to send a message to a corporation is to take their income from them, so do whatever you can to do that.
