I won't post everything to Mastodon from my website because I already have my own personal instance so I guess I own my own content already. It is nice to have a website-first setup if I need it though.

This is more of a test '*note*' more than anything because I've created a custom webhook with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) that automatically posts to Mastodon from my [toots.xml](https://hankchizljaw.io/feed/toots.xml) feed and I want to see if it works.
