## ℹ️ UX Tip

If you're making a whole element clickable, like say, a card: consider creating some sort of timer on `'mousedown'` that is reset on `'mouseup'`. This means that you can see if the timer has run past a threshold and block the action on `'click'`.

One reason you would do this is to allow content in that card to be _selectable_ without the click handler firing off and disrupting the action.
