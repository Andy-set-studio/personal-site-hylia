Do whatever you can to look after yourself and if something makes you smile, do it as often as you can. 

It can be something totally silly. For example, I like to walk past the local Conservative MP's office and stick my middle finger up at him whenever I'm in Cheltenham. It certainly puts a smile on my face.
