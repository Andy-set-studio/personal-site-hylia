This weekend, we’ve had yet another reminder of how amazing our NHS service is.

We had a baby that was safely delivered, followed by incredible aftercare to make absolutely sure that both Baby and Mum were OK. Our midwives were incredible.

This service cost us exactly £0.00. It actually cost more to park my car.

Thank you, NHS. Let’s all do what we can to make sure it sticks around.
