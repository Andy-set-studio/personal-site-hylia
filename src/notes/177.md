I’ve replaced the live chat on [devpal.io](https://devpal.io) with a HTML form. 

This is because over the last 6 months, the increase of anon users either asking if it’s a bot or just saying “hi” have gone through the roof.

It also relied on JavaScript. Not anymore!

It’s also nice to remove a tracking and surveillance device from the site.

The chat service was great, but the metrics I could see were unnecessary. It also mislead users.

**Bonus**: the site is now a test zone for [Stalfos](https://github.com/andybelldesign/stalfos/tree/feature/v2?files=1) V2, so it’s a bit rough around the edges 😬

Also, [@Netlify](//twitter.com/Netlify) forms feel like cheating. A glorious service!
