Delilah is often described by people as the “_the most beautiful cat they've ever seen_” or “_the softest cat they've ever stroked_”. Poor [Dora](/notes/9/) never really gets a look-in when Delilah is about.

But, Delilah is one of the sweetest cats you'll ever meet. Although she's a bit “bitey”, she's full of love, easily forgives and purrs even before you stroke her.
