This [Twitter poll](https://mobile.twitter.com/mxstbr/status/1038073603311448064) that most folks got wrong was intended as a fun challenge but as usual, some of the responses are unhelpful. 

We want the web to be open and inclusive, but then we chastise people for misunderstanding a CSS fundamental. This, while there’s a constant obsession with tools. How can someone be expected to learn CSS when they’re chasing the latest hotness to keep up? It stinks, frankly and I’ll try and make something helpful to counter it.
