I did a test run of Stalfos v2 last night with [devpal.io](https://devpal.io). I tried to do it utility-first, but did find that laborious. I did however very much enjoy doing layout stuff, util-first.

Distributing design tokens was very useful, too, which is what I’m currently enjoying about Tailwind.

I’ve found a few weak points with the Stalfos v2 stuff, so will be adding some functions to get sizes per ratio value to help with component work.
