Today is my last day helping out the fine folks [@clearleft](//twitter.com/clearleft) out on a couple of projects, since December.

Thereâ€™s been _a lot_ of good work done because they are some of the most talented people that Iâ€™ve ever had the pleasure of working with. 

They are very nice people.

***

Iâ€™m going to slow the heck down for a while now and work on some side projects and a small client website.

A much needed change of pace as Iâ€™ve been peddle to the metal since November!

***

I am looking to book a new website project from September onwards, though, so please drop me a line on [me@andy-bell.design](mailto:me@andy-bell.design) if you are looking for a clean, accessible and performant design ðŸ’Œ

Especially get in touch if you are a non-profit and/or good cause.

Lastly, [@clearleft](//twitter.com/clearleft) are hiring a Head of Front-end Development. 

You should [go and work for them](https://clearleft.com/team/jobs/head-of-front-end-development).
