Something I never thought I’d hear myself say: I think my ideal CSS setup is light BEM components with Tailwind utility classes for design tokens and general layout such as flex alignment.

I really don’t think I’ll ever accept full utility classes, though. At that point, you might as well style with JavaScript.
