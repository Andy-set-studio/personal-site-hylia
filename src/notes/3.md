My boss, [Dan](https://twitter.com/de) shared a [shot on Dribbble today](https://dribbble.com/shots/5007708-Outgoings-App-Teaser) of a UI concept of the new <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> that we're building.

It's an exciting project for us because it's giving us an opportunity to practice what we preach with [progressive enhancement](https://medium.com/no-divide/the-power-of-progressive-enhancement-98738766b009). It's also going to be a handy tool for people that need to keep a close eye on their finances.

I love projects like this because I get to try out new technologies and approaches. I'm going use this project as an opportunity to carry on [learning web components](https://webcomponents.club) along with some other tricks with routing and storage. 

More to come soon.
