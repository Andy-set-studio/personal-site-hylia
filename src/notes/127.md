Iâ€™ve put in a PR on <https://npm-uninstall-facebook.com> where the intro copy has been totally reworked. 

Hopefully that will eradicate some of the misinterpretations of its purpose.

Feedback and comments absolutely welcome.

Here's a [preview of that change](https://deploy-preview-21--friendly-shirley-7df1c1.netlify.com/)
