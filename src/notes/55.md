I’ve got an exciting week coming up. 

I’m speaking at [WP Bristol](
https://wpbristol.co.uk/)
 about progressive enhancement on Tuesday night, which will be ace.

Then, I’m starting a project for a very cool new client, which starts with a workshop in Brighton. HMU if you’ll be around for a coffee ☕️
