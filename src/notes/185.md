Hey Piccalilli subscribers 👋

I’m in the process of redesigning and re-platforming [piccalil.li](https://piccalil.li) and it would be great if you, the subscribers of the newsletter could answer a couple of questions to help me make the right decisions. 

You can also subscribe at any time _then_ fill in this survey here: [piccalil.li](https://piccalil.li).
