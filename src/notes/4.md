If you follow me on [Mastodon](https://toots.hankchizljaw.io/@hankchizljaw) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw), you might have noticed that I've been a bit..._busy_ this year. I've put quite a lot of stuff out and I'll admit, I've over-worked a bit, but I've been riding a rather large momentum wave.

I suffered [Burnout really badly](/wrote/burnout) and it took until late last year to get over it. It didn't help that I had *the worst job that I've ever had in this industry* while I was getting over it. A combination of these two meant that I _vanished_ a bit. 

Since joining [No Divide](https://nodividestudio.com) in November, last year, I've been feeling great about the web again. That's why I've put _so much_ out there ðŸ˜…

Now though, it's time to chill and wait for our new baby to arrive.
