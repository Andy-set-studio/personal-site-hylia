I’ve found myself hanging out on Twitter more over the last couple of weeks.

Something has definitely changed, for the better. I think the chronological timeline changes have made a big impact. It feels more like Twitter of old. 

I’ll still be hanging on Mastodon, but I might hang out on Twitter more again too. I’ve really missed folks there.

Hanging out on Twitter more while [looking for a new job](/hire-me) has certainly reminded me of how generous the community can be.
