‪If there’s any organisations that help those affected by the extreme conservatism that is going on in the USA at the moment, who also need help with their website: give me a shout.‬

I’ve got availability coming up in late summer / early autumn and will work at a big discount.‬

‪I especially want to help organisations a that specialise in:‬  ‪

- Helping underrepresented folk’s get their vote‬ ‪
- Planned parenthood ‬ 
‪- Immigration / ICE ‬  ‪

I’m always available on [me@andy-bell.design‬](mailto:me@andy-bell.design).

I want to help you, help others.
