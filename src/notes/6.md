I've come up with a plan that uses [@eleven_ty](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty)'s smart tagging system, a separate [tweets.xml](https://hankchizljaw.io/feed/tweets.xml) feed and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to create a website-first Twitter thing. It also keeps me away from Twitter dot com as much as possible.

Jack _still_ sucks.
