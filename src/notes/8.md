I tried a method that was outlined here: [https://www.hyperborea.org/journal/2017/12/mastodon-ifttt/](https://www.hyperborea.org/journal/2017/12/mastodon-ifttt/). Unfortunately Mastodon wasn't accepting the token as part of a query string parameter.

I've had to roll a little Node middleware that IFTTT posts to. The middleware then posts to my instance's API with the proper `Bearer` header.

A fun Friday night project...
