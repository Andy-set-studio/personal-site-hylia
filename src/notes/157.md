I see it so often when folks talk about using less JS, a bro will say something like:

How many people are building apps like Gmail, really? We’ve got such a weird obsession with “scale”.

‪How much of a bad experience are we causing users on low powered devices and/or with slow connections just to "build something that scales"?‬

‪I wonder if the heavy JS only approaches would be (seemingly) default if those constraints were more common the the western dev world.‬..
