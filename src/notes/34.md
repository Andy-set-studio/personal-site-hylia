This morning, I’m taking my toddler to a local arts and crafts group for kids. According to her Grandma, there’s some _very_ competitive parents, so the pressure is on.

The theme is under the sea. I’ll report back with my toilet roll tube shark later.

It’s nice to do these things with her while I’m on paternity leave.
