I’m really looking forward to speaking at [Inclusive design 24](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2018/) this evening. It’s totally free, online and features some amazing speakers. 

You can catch my talk at 21:00 UTC, where I’ll be talking about the power of progressive enhancement! You can follow along with the [live stream, here](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn7dsvRdQEfEnBxpVztmJ8KCKNJ_P-hR6).
