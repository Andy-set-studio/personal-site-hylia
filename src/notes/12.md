Now that I’ve got a personal site that I’m proud of again, I’ll write some non web dev stuff.

Ideas I’ve had so far are a guide to Mastodon for newcomers and one about my discomfort with large tech companies and how there seems to be a cult-like following of them.

More importantly though, I want to tell you all about the surreal world of my kid’s favourite YouTube character, Bob The Train. Here’s a rather odd taster: [https://youtu.be/cE3LzPQgQmk](https://youtu.be/cE3LzPQgQmk)

**Update:** I forgot the _actual_ most important one. I want to write either a whole article or an article series about my top ten favourite albums. [Here’s the list](https://www.notion.so/HankChizlJaw-s-Top-10-albums-b8d8427e86d149aa8940ffffc6f2e256) for those that may be curious.
