Pro tip, for my fellow dudes.

When someone asks for recommendations for someone for job/contract opportunity: make a conscious effort not to recommend another dude, but instead, recommend a non-dude.

Struggling with that? Diversify your following list. Â 

The same applies if you were thinking of recommending me, too (thank you, if that is the case).

For design stuff, recommend [@TatianaTMac](https://mobile.twitter.com/tatianatmac).

For dev stuff, recommend [@nicmakesstuff](https://mobile.twitter.com/nicmakesstuff).
