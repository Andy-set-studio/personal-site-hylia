Itâ€™s 50 years today since the Apollo 11 crew stepped on the moon for the first time.

The only cool thing about me is that my birthday is on the same day, which is handy, being completely obsessed with space.

A fun fact about me is that I originally joined Twitter because I wanted to follow [@NASA](//twitter.com/NASA). 

It was only after a while that I got into following web folks and such. 

As you can imagine, Iâ€™ve been in my element with the wall-to-wall Apollo coverage recently.
