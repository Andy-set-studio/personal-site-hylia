RSS and web mentions are two things that are making me rather excited about the web platform at the moment.

I abandoned RSS when I abandoned Thunderbird as an email client, years ago, so I feel like I've been missing out. I especially like that folks aren't just writing articles, but sharing links and notes. It feels like the good old days of the web.

A long stretch from the current horrors that certain social networks are bringing.

I'm back on RSS now and it's bringing me a lot of joy.
