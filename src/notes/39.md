I just opened up my little Mongo DB reporting tool and found that [https://
mybrowser.fyi](https://mybrowser.fyi) has generated over 30,000 reports. This is mindblowing.

I feel so lucky that it's taken off as it has. It makes me even happier when cool companies reach out to let me know it's part of their support flow ðŸ™‚
