I had a really good time coaching at [@CodebarBrighton](//twitter.com/CodebarBrighton) tonight. 

I love mentoring folks who are learning web stuff and tonight I got paired with a super cool designer who was learning HTML, CSS and JS. We ended up making some funky stuff!

I'll be back next time I'm down here ðŸš€
