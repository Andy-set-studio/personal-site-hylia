Today is my idea of a perfect Sunday. The rain is lashing down and it’s windy, which to most is the worst type of day. I love weather like this when I’m having an easy-going day at home though. I’ve gotten a bit sick of the hot, muggy weather as I’m more of a cold weather sort of person.

I sit here with a cup of tea in my favourite seat which looks out over the Cotswold hills. I’ve got a roast dinner cooking and my daughter is quietly playing with Duplo in the background.

A perfect day.
