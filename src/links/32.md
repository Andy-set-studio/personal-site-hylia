I keep sending this link to folks who are new to Mastodon, so I thought I might as well keep a link to it. 

Kev does a great job of explaining how it all works in human-terms which is really crucial in getting a wide spectrum of people understanding and using Mastodon.

His email analogy to explain how users from other instances interact is very good too.
