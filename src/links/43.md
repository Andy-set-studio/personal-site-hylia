A really nice write-up by my pal [Lara](https://notlaura.com).

> “It might be frustrating when I can’t always work on what I want when I want (and it’s not like I did that before this job anyway…), but that’s a trade-off for working on a team and on bigger projects. It doesn’t work for one person to just pick up and switch gears at the drop of a hat. Lesson learned.”
