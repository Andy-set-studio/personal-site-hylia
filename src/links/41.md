A super post by [Eric Bailey](http://ericwbailey.design) here.

This is a great takeaway:
>“...computers are awful at understanding the overall situation of the outside world. It’s up to us humans to be the ultimate arbiters in determining if what the computer spits out is useful or not.”

Incredible content like this will only ever help with the mass-adoption of accessible web design.
