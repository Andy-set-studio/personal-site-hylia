I just realised that “My Browser” turned 1 last week 🎉

It’s helped so many people debug browser issues and some companies even have it as part of their support flow.

Roll on another year where I will be adding some more stuff, including better UA parsing 🚀

You can read the introduction post [here](https://medium.com/@andybelldesign/introducing-my-browser-8149cb67a8a8) (⚠️ Medium warning ⚠️).

“My Browser” gave me a whole case study for progressive enhancement in action, too, so I wrote what was arguably my most read post of last year, about the [power of progressive enhancement](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/the-power-of-progressive-enhancement/).
