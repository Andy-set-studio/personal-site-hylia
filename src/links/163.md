I want to spend more time working on stuff that benefits the web community, but I also need to feed my family, so I've created a Patreon!  I’d really appreciate your support so I can help folks learn the web platform.

The ideal situation for me would be working on client work 1/2 to 2/3 of the week and the rest creating tutorials, newsletters and products about:

- Modern CSS
- Web Components 
- Progressive Enhancement
- Accessibility 

Your support would enable that work.
