I’m a _massive_ [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) fan and this post by [@zachleat](//twitter.com/zachleat) (the creator of Eleventy) is absolutely fantastic. 

If you want to give the super-speedy static site generator a go, this is a perfect post to get you started.

For those that don’t already know, this site is very proudly running Eleventy.
