This is straight-up required reading. I'll share my favourite quote from the article:

> “Frameworks and tooling need to explain clearly, in small words, with reproducible instructions how they deliver under-budget experiences, how much room is left after their budgetary cost, and what devices and networks their tools are appropriate in. This will mean that many popular tools are relegated to prototyping. That’s OK.”

Fabulous work by [Alex](https://infrequently.org).
