I’ve long found it hard to fathom the actual benefit of Bitcoin. I struggle with the actual usefulness of the blockchain in general, so I read this with a bias opinion, admittedly.

I did give cryptocurrency a look last year when it spiked, but it felt like a game more than a serious currency. Regardless, I think it could provide use in terms of privacy, maybe.
