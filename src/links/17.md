I relate with this great post by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) a lot. The main thing I was looking for when I was looking for a new job last year was proper _flexibility_.

I’m totally not productive in a 9-5 office environment, so I found working in-house excruciating. Now, I work reasonably “normal” hours, but you’ll often find me working on my own stuff to “warm up”, then work on day job stuff ‘til later in the evening after I’ve had dinner with my family.
