A really interesting look behind the curtain at how Mastodon works from a moderation perspective. [Nolan](https://nolanlawson.com) writes about it so eloquently that even a relative newcomer like myself can understand it.

It sounds like moderators need some serious help from the platform and I think that quality articles like this will encourage the right conversations to happen.
