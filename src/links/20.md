In May 2018, [Lara Schenck](https://notlaura.com) and I made a series on [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) about creating a custom [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) Block from scratch.

It wasn't just about that though. We taught people about [ES6](https://css-tricks.com/learning-gutenberg-4-modern-javascript-syntax/), [Create Gutenblock](https://css-tricks.com/learning-gutenberg-3-primer-with-create-guten-block/), [how Gutenberg works](https://css-tricks.com/learning-gutenberg-2-what-is-gutenberg/), [React](https://css-tricks.com/learning-gutenberg-5-react-101/) and [Webpack](https://css-tricks.com/learning-gutenberg-6-setting-up-a-custom-webpack-config/) in preparation for the main course which was creating the block itself.
