A fabulous article by [Julie](https://twitter.com/syswarren) here. This stuff is right on my mind at the moment and she's articulated it so well. Some good quotes:

> “While men are likely to apply to jobs for which they meet only 60% of the qualifications, women are much more likely to hesitate unless they meet 100% of the listed requirements.”

***

> “To make job listings more appealing, companies can reduce their list of requirements, or at least be more honest about which ones actually matter and choose carefully the words they use.”
