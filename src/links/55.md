A handy post by Chris Coyier on how setting a minimum width of `0px` or using my favourite new CSS thing, `minmax(0, 1fr)` can prevent unwieldy content such as a `<pre>` breaking your layout.

Of course, Chris being Chris, you learn a bunch about how this stuff is calculated, thanks to his excellent knack for explaining complex concepts in an easy to understand way.
