A fabulous post about simplifying entering a date of birth for a user. So many times, a date picker or select menu system is usedâ€”even though they can be a nightmare to use. This is especially true for older people.

I like a text-based approach like the article says. Three fields helps you parse the data too, so everyone wins.
