A quick ðŸ”¥ CSS tip:

If you set your SVG iconâ€™s width and height to `1em`, you can then contextually size it with `font-size`.

It also means that your icon will always be predictably sized by default.

**Update**: Thanks to [@fvsch](https://twitter.com/fvsch)â€™s excellent suggestion, Iâ€™ve created a fork that sets the width and height on the SVG itself: <https://codepen.io/andybelldesign/pen/NoZzav>.
