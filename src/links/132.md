I’ve just pushed out a new thing that I’ve been building called “Tatl”.

It’s a tiny base Web Component class that gives you a Vue-like structure for your components. It’s _very_ much a work in progress, but I thought I’d push it up to see if some folks who are smarter than me fancied giving feedback / contributing.
 
I started working on it last year, but it got put in the icebox while I got settled into freelancing. I’m thinking about Web Components a lot again, recently and this little library is a prerequisite of some plans I’ve got for the future.

Feedback is absolutely welcome and encouraged!
