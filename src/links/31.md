So much good in this post! I find variable fonts absolutely fascinating and considering they could be a powerful accessibility tool further increases that fascination. There are some really handy CodePen demos too.

There is also some really handy information about the WCAG 2.1 text spacing rules which I'm going to make sure that this site complies with.
