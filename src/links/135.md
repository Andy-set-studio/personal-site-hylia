It makes me _super_ happy to see this on [@css](//twitter.com/css). You all know I’m a massive fan of Web Components, so no surprises there.
 
Seeing what looks like it’ll be a comprehensive guide on a publication as popular as CSS-Tricks should only help increase interest in an exciting _native_ technology.

Bet on Web Components, kids.
