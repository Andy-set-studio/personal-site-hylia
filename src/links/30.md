My mental health has certainly improved _considerably_ since I've stepped away from Twitter and I hope the same for Charlie too because she's great.

This quote stuck for me:

> "In retrospect, a single giant character-limited IRC server that you can’t split up into more interesting channels was a fucking terrible idea. But we went with it, because it was an interesting way to hear from random new people and see what they were talking about."
