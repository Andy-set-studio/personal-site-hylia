Right now my main focus is progressive enhancement and accessibility. I'm also working on my new business as an independent designer and developer.

* I'm continuing to work on [My Browser](https://mybrowser.fyi)
* I'm continuing to mentor beginner developers on [Dev Pal](https://devpal.io)
* I'm helping the folks at [Scottâ€™s Bass Lessons](https://scottsbasslessons.com/) with their design system
