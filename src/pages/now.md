It’s an extremely uncertain time at the moment with the Coronavirus pandemic. It’s got me working back from home again which is bittersweet. Bitter that the pandemic forced my hand, but sweet that I’m back working where I am happiest. Over the last 9 months I’ve hired desk space and a little office and wasn’t very happy at either, so it is working out better for me.

I am continuing to focus my attention on:

- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) - A mix of free and premium tutorials, articles and courses about web design and front-end development. It also has a regular newsletter.
- [Front-End Challenges Club](https://front-end-challenges.club/) - Quick, fun challenges and solutions to help you to master front-end development

I’m also keeping the book I co-authored, [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) up to date.
