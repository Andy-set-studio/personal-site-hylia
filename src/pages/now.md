I’m taking a deep breathe and moving my business’ focus from client services work to producing premium tech education content. 

This is via two main platforms:

- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) - A mix of free and premium tutorials, articles and courses about web design and front-end development. It also has a regular newsletter.
- [Front-End Challenges Club](https://front-end-challenges.club/) - Quick, fun challenges and solutions to help you to master front-end development

I’m also keeping the book I co-authored, [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) up to date.
