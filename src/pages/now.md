It’s still an extremely uncertain time at the moment with the Coronavirus pandemic. It’s got me working back from home again which is bittersweet. Bitter that the pandemic forced my hand, but sweet that I’m back working where I am happiest. 

I recently hired desk space and a little office and wasn’t very happy at either, so it is working out better for me.

I am continuing to focus my attention on:

- [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) - A mix of free and premium tutorials, articles and courses about web design and front-end development. It also has a regular newsletter.
- [Learn Eleventy From Scratch Course](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/) - The debut course for Piccalilli which has just launched. It’s a linear project-based course where you build a [stunning website](//issue33.com) to learn Eleventy.
- [CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/) - A CSS methodology that I use to build out front-ends of _all_ sizes. I’m making more material such as workshops, talks and documentation.

I’m also keeping the book I co-authored, [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) up to date.
