Here’s all the stuff I use day-to-day to do my job.

## Code setup

I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for coding and I use it within [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). You can [check out my Vim setup](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/chizlvim) over on GitHub.

For my editor and terminal font, I use [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles). I created a version of [Panda Syntax](https://github.com/PandaTheme) for my theme.

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and/or [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/) if things get a bit hairy. I also like to have a go with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) sometimes, for old times sake.

I use [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for writing nearly all content. It’s a super good, focused writing tool.

## Computer stuff

I have a [2019 16” MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/uk/macbook-pro-16/) with an 8 core i9 processor, 1TB SSD drive and 32GB of RAM. It’s by far the best Mac I’ve ever had and I’ve been a Mac user since the original weird coloured iMacs! 

I’ve got an [LG 27UD88-W](https://www.lg.com/uk/monitors/lg-27UD88-W), 4K, 27” USB-C screen that does the job nicely. All I do is plug the ol’ MacBook in. I prefer Apple Cinema Displays but they’re long gone now.

I have a [RØDE Podcaster](http://www.rode.com/microphones/podcaster) for recording my voice.

## Organisation 

I live in notebooks and my life revolves around my Bullet Journal, which is a [LEUCHTTURM1917 Bullet Journal](https://www.leuchtturm1917.co.uk/bullet-journal.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIle7q9OCU5wIVCFXTCh26LAFjEAAYAiAAEgLSjvD_BwE). I also have piles and piles of [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) which I use for sketches, lists and general note taking.

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is the beating heart for everything else. I plan content, run projects and run all client work through there.

I also use [Loom](https://loom.com) _loads_ for screencasting ([especially for clients](/wrote/screencasting-the-secret-sauce-for-less-time-wasted-in-meetings/)).

## This website

This website is a customised version of my [Eleventy Theme, Hylia](https://hylia.website). You can [see the source code here](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/personal-site-hylia).

Tech it uses:

- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) 
- Sass 
- Design Tokens
- Web Components

## Office

I like plants and have a Bonsai Tree, some succulents and a dangly boi which I have no idea what it’s called.

It’d be rude not to show y’all the office, so here it is!
