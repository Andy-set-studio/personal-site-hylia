00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.970
<v ->This is a quick look at this homepage</v>

2
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.603
for Front-End Challenges Club.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.270
It's a look and feel video.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.140
There's no other feedback that's required.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.530
The only feedback we need from this is,

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.140
how do you feel about the look and feel,

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.190
the colors, the typography, the spacing?

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.200
All the things that make it look like it does.

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.140
Do we like the color?

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.750
All that sort of thing.

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.100
In terms of functionality,

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.940
we don't need to worry so much about that right now.

13
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.550
We just need feedback on the look and feel

14
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.460
and why things are being put together.

15
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.730
So let me quickly explain what's going on.

16
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.110
So you got your standard header at the top

17
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.980
with some navigation links.

18
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100
And there's a primary call to action, straight away.

19
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.823
The sign up, and that's a really common pattern.

20
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.450
We're sticking it straight in there.

21
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.283
Then you got the intro,

22
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.020
so you got what the name of the project is,

23
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.880
Front-End Challenges Club.

24
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.643
And there's a quick summary, so, "Quick, fun challenges

25
00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:57.737
"and solutions to help you to master front-end development.

26
00:00:57.737 --> 00:00:58.820
"Sign up now."

27
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.563
Then this is important, for the two price points.

28
00:01:01.563 --> 00:01:06.563
$10 per month or $95 per year.

29
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.230
Sign up.

30
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.060
So that's trying to immediately catch a user,

31
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.810
or a potential user, and get them straight in the door.

32
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.520
Then in the second column,

33
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.673
we've got what the current challenge is.

34
00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:20.840
So the latest challenge.

35
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.820
This one is challenge number four, Progress Button.

36
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.240
And then we've got, this is all grouped together,

37
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990
because the challenge has got a related solution to it.

38
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.760
We've got View Challenge and then Learn Solution.

39
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.900
And then the iconography here is on the challenge,

40
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
being the mountains, so this is something to overcome.

41
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.490
And then the compass being the solution,

42
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.490
sort of guiding and ensuring then where to build them.

43
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.913
So that's where I teach them how to use it.

44
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.893
Then you got, after that, Recent Challenges:

45
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.053
Duotone Card, Toggle Switch, Email Sign-up Forms.

46
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.110
This gives someone an opportunity landing

47
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.360
to just have a quick look at the other content, as well.

48
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.860
So you could limit this, to say, six,

49
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.590
so you got a nice grid,

50
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.200
once you got some more stuff going on there.

51
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.470
And then it just helps them to get a feel

52
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.960
for the challenges, at least, anyway.

53
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.600
The solutions are all pay walled.

54
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.460
So then, then there's the last opportunity

55
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.293
there at the bottom.

56
00:02:20.293 --> 00:02:22.120
Now I've reversed the colors.

57
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.150
I've gone for the magenta as the primary background color

58
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.610
and then using the same treatment as the intro here,

59
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.020
sign up for membership.

60
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.080
This is the second chance of trying to get a user in.

61
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.390
Then you've got columns of content here,

62
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.597
you've got, "Front-End Challenges Club members

63
00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:40.980
"get all sorts of benefits including."

64
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.347
So then you get, "Full access content,

65
00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.227
"access to private community members,

66
00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:48.120
"access to exclusive AMA sessions."

67
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.610
And then again, the more we reiterate,

68
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.610
that memberships start at $10 per month or $95 per year.

69
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.263
Sign up for membership.

70
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.670
And then you got your standard footer going on here

71
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.323
with the Privacy Policy, Code of Conduct link, et cetera.

72
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.660
Again, reminder, the feedback that we need from this video

73
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.420
is just what you're feeling about the look and feel.

74
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.470
Don't rush the feedback, think about it.

75
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.453
I can progress with other work in the meantime.

76
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.600
Take your time, think about what you like,

77
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.603
what you don't like.

78
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.540
Yeah, let me know your thoughts,

79
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.050
and again feel free to record a screencast like this.

80
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.053
Take care, see ya!
