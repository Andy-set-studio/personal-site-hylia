Inspired by [Sophie](https://localghost.dev/2019/09/everything-i-googled-in-a-week-as-a-professional-software-engineer/) and [Chris](https://css-tricks.com/web-developer-search-history/)’s recent posts, I thought I’d share with you what a day of me fighting with PHP looks like in a search engine.

I’m proper rubbish at PHP, so days like today are a real struggle, as you’ll see. I dunno if this search history will help or not, but I like being transparent and showing that it’s not all good days.

## Searches

- **Vim set spaces 4** - yup, old project time
- **Stripe get subscription PHP** - their docs are super good
- **PHP isnull** - I knew what I was looking for, but clearly got it wrong
- **Craft 2 redirect plugin** - I wanted to redirect within a plugin, but of course, thanks to SEO, I got loads of plugins I didn’t want
- **Craft 2 redirect** - Ah yeh, I forgot everything is assuming that you’re in a Twig template
- **Craft 2 redirect in Controller** - `$this->redirect('url')` for anyone interested
- **Amazon Polly** - procrastination time (holy moly though, it looks good)
- **PHP if array has items** - yup
- **PHP throw exception** - getting there
- **css tricks search history** - “I know, I’ll do one of them articles”
