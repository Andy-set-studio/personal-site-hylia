This week, my thoughts have very much been on politics, unsurprisingly. The Brexit situation is becoming more and more agonising by the day. 

I’m worrying a lot about the people who have already been completely shafted by austerity, because it’s all going to get much, much worse for them. That will be the case unless Article 50 is revoked. I know it’s not a silver bullet, but remaining in the EU and ending this political crisis will give us a fighting chance of repairing the wider issues that got us here in the first place. 

I get very frustrated when people blame "Brexit voters"—especially those who already struggle with poverty, because it’s not their fault. Imagine getting fucked over by the state, day after day, regardless of what government is in place and being offered actual change. Anyone would vote for change in that situation—especially when the other option was to keep everything as it was. 

Blame the remain campaign and the elites who got us in this mess, instead. Blame the Conservatives and Labour, equally, too. 

This current Brexit situation is why I wrote an [open letter to my MP](https://andy-bell.design/wrote/open-letter-to-laurence-robertson-mp/), who is a Conservative. I believe mutual respect and productive conversation is required to fix this mess and I hope that a message is sent that I, a Green Party member can still write a constructive letter to someone who is from the _complete opposite side_ of the political spectrum—even when there is so much seething hatred from this side.

I can at least try, anyway.

I did have a very nice trip to Brighton to spend a couple of days with [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com) this week. They’re awesome people. I even managed to [see a bit of sun](https://andy-bell.design/notes/160/) and get on the beach.

I also had some lush fish & chips and great conversation with [Danielle](https://twitter.com/dhuntrods), [Cassie](https://twitter.com/cassiecodes) and [Jeremy](https://twitter.com/adactio). 

A very nice trip indeed.

I have a feeling that this week will be very turbulent for my fellow Brits. Let’s all support each other through this hell.
