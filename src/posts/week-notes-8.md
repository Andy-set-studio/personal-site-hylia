The web [turned 30 years old](https://web30.web.cern.ch/home) this week. I’m so lucky that it has given me an amazing career and to pay it back, I’m going to continue nagging everyone to use the web platform and embrace progressive enhancement. 

I also celebrated the web’s birthday by creating a [joke shitpost](https://twitter.com/andybelldesign/status/1105440749687066624) that...well...took off a bit. It’s all good fun, but the message is clear: we use _far too much_ JavaScript. 

Apart from my Twitter notifications melting down, it’s been a very uneventful week. I’ve written a load of CSS, as per, and I also spent some time talking with my pal, [Alex Carpenter](https://twitter.com/hybrid_alex) about Web Components and progressive enhancement for his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2jJoQlzvLPvnYfowAEVaOg). I’ll be able to share the video with you all, soon. 

I’ve also been completely addicted to the latest [Good Tiger album](https://song.link/album/s/3s3TMBbNiBIEzASYKcgPgp).

I’ve got a busy week ahead with a trip to Brighton to see my pals at [Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/). The weather forecast says it’ll be sunny, so I might finally get some fish and chips by the sea.

Have a good week!
