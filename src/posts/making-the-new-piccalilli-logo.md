The initial logo for [Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/) was rushed together in about 10 minutes in illustrator and let‚Äôs be honest, it was shit.

![The old logo which is a yellow and red jar with ‚ÄúPiccalilli‚Äù written next to it](https://hankchizljaw.imgix.net/piccalilli-old.jpg?auto=format&q=60)

I hated it pretty much from day one, but wanted to focus on making the newsletter, so just dealt with it. It has been a long running todo of mine to ‚Äúsort it‚Äù though.

One thing that was an absolute priority for this overhaul of Piccalilli was getting a really solid brand in place. I wanted to do it _properly_ too, so I grabbed a trusty Field Notes and started drawing.

Initially I came up with some crap concepts of cute vegetable characters that happen to be ingredients of piccalilli.

![A two page spread in my notebook has two awful drawings of peppers](https://hankchizljaw.imgix.net/pepper-pals.jpeg?auto=format&q=60)

I wasn‚Äôt digging them _at all_, mainly because I am awful at drawing. I focused instead on the spiciness of piccalilli itself (you can really go to town on the mustard and chillis and make a [super tasty and _spicy_ piccalilli](https://www.waitrose.com/home/recipes/recipe_directory/h/hot-spicy-piccalilli.html)) and that brought so many more creative ideas.

So, I got back to the sketch book and concentrated on two parts: spiciness and badges (or even food labels).

![A group of concepts that go from rough sketches, to vector scamps, all the way to the finished product](https://hankchizljaw.imgix.net/piccalilli-progress.jpg?auto=format&q=60)

As you can see, all of the concepts were similar and the evolution was pretty dramatic. I really put this down to staying in my notebook for as long as possible and I _really_ recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOPA0NaeTBk) by [Aaron Draplin](http://draplin.com/) on his process, because it‚Äôs what is lodged in my head now during the rare opportunities I get to do this sort of design.

After all of the work and thinking, here‚Äôs the final product:

![The Piccalilli logo, which is a badge with ‚ÄúPiccalilli - Dang Spicy Tutorials‚Äù written around the edges with a red chilli in the middle](https://hankchizljaw.imgix.net/piccalilli-wide.jpg?auto=format&q=60 'I say final product but I still can‚Äôt decide if it should be est. 2020 or 2019')

I‚Äôm pretty darn proud of it. Branding and logo design really isn‚Äôt my strength as a designer, so I find it _very_ hard. I‚Äôm so happy that I persevered with this one though because I feel like it‚Äôs improved my skills and confidence as a designer.

This approach of chillies and badges is giving me loads of creative freedom, because there‚Äôs a lush colour palette there and I can utilise spiciness to describe tutorial/course difficulty levels (amongst other things). That font is to _die for_ too.

## Wrapping up

This is just a short post about the logo specifically because I thought someone might find the process useful. [Go and read about why this has all started](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/piccalilli:-the-future/) and then [sign up for updates](https://piccalil.li/) üöÄ
