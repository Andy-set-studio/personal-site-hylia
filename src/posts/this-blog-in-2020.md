This is just a quick note to say that the blog will have a little shift around this year. Last year, I did a lot of tutorial based articles, but with [Front-End Challenges Club](https://front-end-challenges.club/) now being a big part of my life, I don’t really want to write tutorials on here.

Instead, articles will be more of an insight of my day-to-day work as a freelancer. I’m also starting to focus more on educational material and products, so a lot of the content on here will be behind the scenes stuff. That starts today with [Tracking my time](/wrote/tracking-my-time/), where I talk about making my days more efficient with time tracking.

I think I’ll also do some screencasting/streaming of me working as both a screen test for the courses and to give folks an idea of how I work.

Happy new year, pals. Let’s all have the best possible year!
