People are suddenly working from home and I know from experience how difficult it can be. I personally prefer the separation, but I know that others really struggle with it, so Iâ€™ve created two communities to try to help.

## Piccalilli Community 

**Link**: <https://community.piccalil.li/>  
**Code of Conduct**: <https://piccalil.li/code-of-conduct/>

I was planning to set up the Piccalilli Community in a couple of months time as the site started getting more content and the courses started getting published, but Iâ€™ve pushed that forward. I think itâ€™ll be nice for people to be able to hang out, chat about front-end development and design in a friendly, safe environment away from the high pressure, unsafe environments that are Twitter and Hacker News. 

Itâ€™s already shaping up to be a super friendly place, so you will be more than welcome to come along and join in with us.

## Pals Discord

**Code of Conduct**: <https://piccalil.li/code-of-conduct/>

I also set up a Discord where people can just hang out and be pals. Thereâ€™s no need to talk about tech stuffâ€”just hang out and enjoy yourselves. I was inspired by [Joel Califa, who also set up something similar](https://twitter.com/notdetails/status/1238956925192151041) (where Iâ€™m also a member) and I think itâ€™s a great idea.

People are going to be spending a lot of time in Slack for work, so I didnâ€™t want to set one of those up. Discord also do Voice (and video) channels which I think will be perfect to satisfy this need:

> Is it feasible for someone to create a @zoom_us room where people can just pop in throughout the day?
> 
> Iâ€™m thinking for those who are feeling isolated who want to at least hang out with some folks while they work.
> 
> Me and a buddy used to do this on skype years ago and it was nice

I like how people will be able to drop in and hang out whenever they like. Again, this place is already shaping up to be nice as heck.

The Code of Conduct of Conduct is the same as the Piccalilli one for now.

## Wrapping up

Iâ€™m fully aware of my own privilege so please, if you think Iâ€™m missing something in terms of keeping people safe, please let me know. 

I really hope these little communities will help _you_ if you are struggling a bit. Weâ€™re in it for the long-haul with COVID-19, so little things like this can go a long way.

Take it easy and wash your hands ðŸ–¤
