I walk, a lot. It's something I've always done and it's something almost I rely on. Luckily, I live in a sleepy town called [Winchcombe](http://winchcombe.co.uk/) which is famous for its walking routes. I also have a few go-to routes that I came up with myself.

The main reason I love walking—aside from the exercise—is that I do a lot of _thinking_ and general processing of what's going on in my life. As it stands there's a _tonne_ happening, with our new baby due at any moment and some professional turmoil that's taking a bit out of me too. Because I get this time to walk on my own, in the beautiful Cotswolds countryside, I feel I can deal with this stuff a lot better than I have previously in a bustling city environment.

It's not all doom and gloom though. A lot of the ideas that I have happen on these walks. I came up with [My Browser](/wrote/introducing-my-browser/) because I went for a reasonably “angry” walk after a testing exchange with a client over a tricky bug. When I came home, my mind was buzzing with ideas, rather than negative thoughts.

I also make a lot of life decisions on a walk and there's a lot of that going on right now, so I've found I'm doing much _longer_ walks. I've just got back in after a 4.5 mile slog, but I feel really good. So good, that I decided to write a post.

If you live around [Winchcombe](http://winchcombe.co.uk/), you'll probably spot me during the week, at around lunchtime on one of my walks. Soon though, they won't be solitary walks anymore—but instead—with our second child as I show her my favourite routes from her stroller.
