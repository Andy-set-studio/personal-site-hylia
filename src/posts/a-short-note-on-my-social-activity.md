I'm going to step away from Twitter for a while. I'll still post stuff—especially when I'm up to something I think y'all might find interesting, but the platform is just too toxic to spend any amount of time on. I've recently done the same with Facebook and have certainly benefitted from that decision.

You can find me over at Mastodon. Here's a [link to my profile](https://toots.hankchizljaw.io/@hankchizljaw). I'll be a lot more active over there and I hope to see you folks around there too.

I'm also going to re-work this site and get on the RSS train. I love [Zach Leatherman's](https://mastodon.social/@zachleat) [11ty generator](http://11ty.io) and I'll use that. I just wish there was something out there that would make posting short notes with markdown easier—especially from my phone. Maybe something will crop up.

Anyway, I hope to see you all soon on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@hankchizljaw) or wherever. I'll still check my Twitter DMs, but you're probably better off dropping me an [email](mailto:andy@hankchizljaw.io).

Take care of yourselves.
