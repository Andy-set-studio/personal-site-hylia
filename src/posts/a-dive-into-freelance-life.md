After a rather lengthy, draining search for a new role, Iâ€™ve decided to give freelance design and development a go. I feel like this could be the best way for me to work on things that genuinely make a positive impact on people, while also maintaining work-life balance for my young family.

## Making work, work for me

The gang and I at [No Divide](https://nodividestudio.com/) are going on hiatus and I want to maintain the flexible work day that we had there. We very much made work fit around us, rather than the other way around and I was struggling to get a role in a company that worked like that.

I also want to maintain a sensible pace of work. We put a lot of consideration into what we did there and Iâ€™ve struggled to find companies that would be an exact fit on that front. Itâ€™s not to say we necessarily did things _better_, but itâ€™s my preferred way of working, rather than shipping fast and frequently.

After a couple of ideal opportunities got away from me, I decided to go for the next best thing: independence. I actually started my career in the web as a freelancer, back in 2009, so itâ€™ll be interesting to do it again with _much_ more experience and _much_ better contacts. Iâ€™ve learnt how _not_ to do things in various agency roles too, so I feel pretty confident that Iâ€™ll do it right this time.

## The sort of work Iâ€™m looking for

Iâ€™m really into progressive enhancement, user experience, accessibility and inclusivity. Iâ€™m multi-disciplined in that I work as both a designer and a developer. This means I can work from concept, right though to delivery if needed. Any projects that allow me to do that will be warmly received.

These are the sort of projects / contexts that Iâ€™d be most useful in:

-   A new startup that needs help making an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> or prototype
-   Design systems
-   Pattern libraries (design and/or build)
-   User experience research, design and prototypes
-   User interface design
-   HTML and CSS development
-   React, Vue and Node development
-   Accessibility audits and improvements
-   WordPress / Craft CMS / Perch CMS websites (design and/or build)
-   Jekyll / Hugo / Gatsby / Eleventy websites (design and/or build)
-   Development for agencies that need a bit of help to get projects done

## Hire me

Iâ€™m booking projects for 2019, so Iâ€™d love to talk. I prefer to work remotely, but Iâ€™m very happy to come to you for meetings and workshops.
