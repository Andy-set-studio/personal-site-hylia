I see this sort of phrase dotted around social media every now and then:

> “We do X like this, because we’re trying to compete with native apps”

I always find it a bit confusing because oftentimes, “X” is a complicated solution to an already existing, acceptable platform technology, like...um...using CSS-in-JS over CSS, for instance. I also find the phrase confusing because “X” can sometimes mimic the way native app developers do something in a native app programming environment, like Swift or Java, with storyboards and views.

The thing I find the most confusing, though is the concept of competing by _mimicking_. In any other context, it’d be laughable that someone would _compete_ by _mimicking_ someone else. 

The whole idea of competing with native apps seems pretty daft to me, too. The web gives us so much for free that app developers could only _dream_ of, like URLs and the ability to publish to the _entire world_ for free, immediately.

In my mind, the only way to “compete” with native apps is to _do better than native apps_—and with the web platform consistently improving and enabling us to produce app-like experiences, with Service Workers, ES6+ JavaScript, modern CSS and Web Components: we are very much on the path to _do better than native apps_. This includes the handy Progressive Web App capabilities that we have available to us, too.

As [Jeremy Keith says](https://adactio.com/journal/12461):

> “If the goal of the web is just to compete with native, then we’ve set the bar way too low.”

I believe in the web and will continue to believe that building Progressive Web Apps that _embrace_ the web platform will be far superior to the non-inclusive walled garden that is native apps and their app stores. I just wish that others thought like that, too.
