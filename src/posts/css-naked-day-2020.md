I was browsing my RSS feeds and came across [this post](https://laurakalbag.com/css-naked-day-2020/) by the legendary [Laura Kalbag](https://twitter.com/LauraKalbag). It’s inspired me to also have a CSS Naked Day on this site, too. 

Semantic HTML is incredibly important and switching this site over was actually really painless. The only thing I had to do was set a proper width and height on my logo. Maybe I should disable CSS more often to catch these things, being that I’m such a proponent of progressive enhancement. [Check out the commit here](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/personal-site-hylia/commit/c5e7d63cb5a913614ac68c1ed2e4c83d1d30d2c9). 

Maybe try on your site today, too? Regardless, [go over to Laura’s blog and read her post](https://laurakalbag.com/css-naked-day-2020/) as she covers why today matters really well.
